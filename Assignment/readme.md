Thanks chen teacher, for sharing your knowledge, i learn so much

Note:
Teacher, 石光 80-95% really understand the what i do and finish by my self, always try to understand the code then start do it my by self, No copy other student code.
Teacher, if you see in the code, every line have (// note) like this, Yes, after i finish my code, i always sent the pure code to the chatgpt and tell chatgpt to create note for each line. i just think like this, if i create the note by my self it will take so long time, so i always sent the pure code after i finish, to chatgpt for regenerate the note for each line the promt is like this "please explain each code, use English and note in the code directly using //"
I do this, for more understand the code, and if somebody see the code, will can understand each line function.
